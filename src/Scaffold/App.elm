{-| defProgram' is the complete way to define an ProgramInput. ProgramInput is configured with
three functions. `update` and `present` should be familiar to users of StartApp, except for the
fact that they always have the current time. `stage` is a special addition which allows one to
use the program Mailbox address from a context in which the model can be updated.

The use case for `stage` which inspired it's existence is as follows: suppose you have a really
big model with a really, really big view. There is enough data that keen algorithms and data
structures, as well as avoiding redundant computations during presentation becomes a neccessity.

You can then structure your application as follows. Represent all these components as instances of
Machine. From inside `stage`, you can present _only the ones that will or should actually be seen_,
and cache the results in the model. Since you can create an updated model from here, you can save
anything that may be later needed during presentation.

`stage` is called only once after an entire list of actions is executed. If you get a list of 1000
actions, you can still guarantee the work in stage will be done only once, before presentation.
_The primary reason stage has access to the address is because it enables you to call present on
any sub components ahead of time for caching purposes._ -}

-- ORBITER AGENTS
--
--  These primitives are designed to make it more concise to specify complex branching contingencies
-- in tasks before closing them off either with error reports (see "taps", such as it'sErrorConnector).
-- or with lists of actions to execute on success. We allow control over whether or not something is
-- interpreted as success or failure at a level that enables total intervention, so business logic
-- complexity is not limited when constructing contingency graphs (task branching). Using the Elm
-- Architecture as per usual, we can have logarithmic code size.

{-| The basic program agent. Takes two functions, one of which transforms a successful result in to
an AgentStatus, and one which does the same for task failure results. This transforms an arbitrary
task in to an ProgramTask. Notice that we can easily succeed anyway even if the task failed, or vice
versa, because we get an AgentStatus which may be successful or failing either way. This means you
can skip error handling altogether if you already know what to do with the failure from the scope
you're in; you can simply map the failure on to some actions that perform an appropriate
contingency. -}
