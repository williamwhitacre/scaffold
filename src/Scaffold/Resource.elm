# Conditional Derivations

`deriveIf` and `deriveIfNow` are given as more flexible and readable versions of `assumeInCase`
and `assumeInCaseNow`. Neither muddies the waters with the Maybe type, and the transformation
can be any `Resource euser v -> Resource euser v`, which makes these highly nestable by comparison
to their respective older counterparts.

{-| `deltaTo` applies the given transformation function to the pending changes to the
`Resource` structure, producing a partial structure representing only what has changed since the
last call to `integrate`. The resulting partial structure is intended for use as a delta, to be
passed to `update` for some other Resource structure. This results in a simple one-way data binding.

To introduce k-way data binding, one need only use the `interpret` function to transform the
`ResourceTask` output of the subordinate views back in to deltas that transform the origin
`Resource` structure. NOTE that this implies when one wishes for the origin structure to reflect
changes to one of it's subordinates, one must dispatch UserTasks that succeed with the intended
changes. This can be very clean as long as there is a bijection between the origin structure
and each of it's subordinates. The complexity of the mapping is of course dependent on your record
design, so one must still take care. -}
