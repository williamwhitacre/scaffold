{-| This module contains the "Resource Base" symachine, which is in essence a unique compromise between data binding
and explicit fetching and writing.

A Resource is datum whose state is concretely fuzzy because it must be retrieved from
or synchronized with one or more remote services. The bulk of these functions are intended to be used together as a DSL
that provides very concise reductions and conditionally executed contingencies for bad data, as well as very
succinct mapping from fuzzy knowledge states on to concrete views.

It is also possble to compose transformations and mapping
on to pending remote operation results, so that longer running asynchronous transformations (including fetching and manipulation)
can be composed as deeply as desired. The documentation is underway.

-- applications of `dispatchIf` and `dispatchInCase`, and reduced with a declared plan just as cleanly
-- at any future stage using `therefore`, `decideBy`, and `assumeIf`. One can freely alternate
-- between Inquiries and causal reductions, whose most important primitives are given in respective
-- lists above, and then pipe the future state of the knowledge back in to any part of the program
-- using the configuration built using `knowledgeSink`, and optionally `resolvingAllBy`.
-- `knowledgeSink` takes an address of type `Signal.Address (Resource euser v)` and produces an

-- normalize all Error results in to Resource in some uniform way. The default if this is not

use it directly. Calling *Integrate should be done after every update sequence during staging, which
results in all operations in a knowledge base being replaced with pendingResource. If you stick to
this, the presence of pendingResource is a guarantee you'll be getting a delta back about it
assuming your wiring's not broken. -}

elsewhere, `therefore` has no effect on knowledge that satisfies `isNotKnown`. -}
defResource : v -> Resource euser v

{-| Map Result in to Resource. You'll need this if you want to roll your own knowledge base remotes,
which is quite easy to do due to the pluggability of the knowledge module. The function specifies how
to interpret errors. This is important in the case that you have to deal with permissions symachines.
Some of your errors might be due to access denial, others might be due to unintentional errors. Use
forbiddenResource and undecidedResource respectively for these cases. -}

{-| Map Maybe in to Resource. Since Maybe doesn't carry errors, semantically Nothing means
"definitely nothing". For this reason, you may want to use it something like this:

    maybeOr voidResource myPossibleThing

If you implement an operation that uses some existing code that returns a Maybe, that would be a
good place to use this. Just be mindful that this _does not give you the power to handle errors_.
Result should always be preferred in the case that there is any chance of things going wrong, and
`resultOr` should definitely see a lot more mileage in a production app that deals with lots of
unpredictable data.

{-| Create a knowledge record stub. The content of the knowledge base will be bound to the content
of the record according to the `recordField` definitions you give. A knowledge record stub is not
yet completed with a concrete userrecord. Use this in your definitions. Create instances of your
knowledge record type by using `recordSet` on the result of `record`. -}

{-| Map a record field to a key in the knowledge base. The types in the record can be any odd combination
given that the userrecord type can be anything. However, all fields in the record must have a mapping to
and from some knowledge type which can represent any of the fields. This is not as tricky as one might
initially surmise. Your userrecord type should have a corresponding tag union type with a tag for each
record field. To make this clean, you should have a bijection between the record fields and the tags. Here's
an example:

    type Fields = FooField Int | BarField String

    type alias MyRecord =
      { foo : Int
      , bar : String
      }

    myRecordFields =
      recordField (\k r -> { r | foo = k }) (.foo >> FooField) "foo"
      >> recordField (\k r -> { r | bar = k }) (.bar >> BarField) "bar"

    .....

    myResourceRecord =
      record address { foo = 42, bar = "answer" } |> myRecordFields

{-| Retrieve a knowledge from the knowledge record using some getter. Avoiding stringly-typed nonsense that you can't protect from
runtime errors is generally a good idea. Since records have an enumerable set of contant field names, it makes more sense to use
this method to get from records. This won't compile if it's wrong. For example:

    recordAt .myFieldThatWillNotCompileIfItDoesntExist myRecord

-}
