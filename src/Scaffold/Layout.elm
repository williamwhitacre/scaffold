{-| Flatten a group using automatic bounds for the inner and outer bounds. This will produce the
tightest bounding box possible around the target, and place the handle at (0, 0) relative to the resulting
bounding box. This can result in the handle being placed outside of the group, but this can be desirable for
positioning. For example, I may want to grab something at (-5, -5), so I can position it's top left
corner relative to some outer box with (5, 5) padding. -}

{-| Flatten a group using an exact bound. If this is specified to be autoBounds, then the following
equivalency holds:

Otherwise, the items in the group are positioned in the resulting item relative to the top left corner of the bounds and
the resulting item shall have the exact size of the given bounds. -}
